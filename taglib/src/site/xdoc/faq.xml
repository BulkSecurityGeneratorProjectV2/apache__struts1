                    name="Will the Struts tags support other markup languages such as WML">
                <p>
                    The framework itself is markup neutral. The original Struts
                    taglibs are only one example of how
                    presentation layer components can access the framework.
                    The framework objects are exposed
                    through the standard application, session, and request
                    contexts, where any Java component in
                    the application can make use of them.
                </p>

                <p>Markup extensions that use the framework are available for
                    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity">Velocity</a>
                    and
                    <a href="http://www.openroad.ca/opencode/">XLST,</a>
                    among others.
                    A new Struts tag library for
                    <a href="#jsf">Java Server Faces</a>
                    is also in development.
                </p>

            <subsection
                    name="Can I use multiple HTML form elements with the same name?">
                <p>
                    Yes. Define the element as an array and the framework will
                    autopopulate it like any other.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        private String[] id= {};
                        public String[] getId() { return this.id; }
                        public void setItem(String id[]) {this.id = id;}
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>

                </p>

            <a name="multipleSubmits"/>
            <subsection
                    name="Can I have multiple submit buttons on the same form?">
                <p>
                    <strong>Yes</strong>
                    . The issue is that only one action class can be
                    associated with a single form. So the real issue is how do
                    I decode
                    multiple submit types to a single
                    <code>Action</code>
                    class.
                    There is more than one way to achieve this functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The way that is suggested by the framework is right out of the
                    javadoc for
                    <a href="../api/org/apache/struts/actions/LookupDispatchAction.html">
                        <code>LookupDispatchAction.</code>
                    </a>
                    Basically,
                    <code>LookupDispatchAction</code>
                    is using the keys from
                    <code>ApplicationProperties.resources</code>
                    as keys to a map of actions
                    available to your
                    <code>Action</code>
                    class. It uses
                    <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/reflection/">
                        reflection</a>
                    to
                    decode the request and invoke the proper action. It also
                    takes advantage of
                    the 
                    <a href="../userGuide/struts-html.html#submit">
                        <code>&lt;html:submit&gt;</code>
                    </a>
                    tags and is straight forward to implement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can roll your own with JavaScript events and
                    <code>javascript:void
                        (document.forms["myform"].submit)</code>
                    on any html element. This gives you
                    control of how you want your page to look. Again you
                    will have to decode the expected action in the
                    <code>execute</code>
                    method of
                    your action form if you choose this route.

            <subsection
                    name="Why doesn't the focus feature on the &lt;html:form> tag work in every circumstance?">
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, there is some disagreement between the
                    various browsers, and different versions of the same
                    browser, as to how the focus can be set.
                    The &lt;html:form> tag provides a quick and easy
                    JavaScript that will set the focus on a form
                    for most versions of most browsers.
                    If this feature doesn't work for you, then you should set
                    the focus using your own JavaScript.
                    The focus feature is a convenient "value-add" -- not a
                    core requirement of the tag.
                    If you do come up with a JavaScript that provides the
                    final solution to this project,
                    please post your patch to this
                    <a href="http://issues.apache.org/struts/browse/STR-899">

            <a name="checkbox"/>
            <subsection
                    name="Why are my checkboxes not being set from ON to OFF?">
                <p>
                    A problem with a checkbox is that the browser will only
                    include it in the request
                    when it is checked. If it is not checked, the HTML
                    specification suggests that it
                    not be sent (i.e. omitted from the request). If the value
                    of the checkbox is being
                    persisted, either in a session bean or in the model, a
                    checked box can never
                    unchecked by a HTML form -- because the form can never
                    send a signal to uncheck
                    the box. The application must somehow ascertain that since
                    the element was not
                    sent that the corresponding value is unchecked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The recommended approach for framework applications is to use
                    the reset method in the
                    ActionForm to set all properties represented by checkboxes
                    to null or false. The
                    checked boxes submitted by the form will then set those
                    properties to true. The
                    omitted properties will remain false. Another solution is
                    to use radio buttons
                    instead, which always submit a value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is important to note that the HTML specification
                    recommends this same
                    behavior whenever a control is not "successful". Any blank
                    element in a HTML
                    form is not guaranteed to submitted. It is therefor very
                    important to set the
                    default values for an ActionForm correctly, and to
                    implement the reset method
                    when the ActionForm might kept in session scope.

                    You can submit a form with a link as below.
                    BTW, the examples below assume you are in an &lt;html:form&gt;
                    block and 'myForm'
                    is picked up from the struts-config.xml name field of the
                    action.
                </p>
                <source>
                    &lt;a
                    href='javascript:void(document.forms["myForm"].submit()&gt;My
                    Link&lt;/a&gt;
                </source>
                <p>
                    Now the trick in the action is to decode what action you
                    intend to perform.
                    Since you are using JavaScript, you could set a field
                    value and look for it in
                    the request or in the form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ... html/javascript part ...
                </p>
                <source>
                    &lt;input type='hidden' value='myAction' /&gt;
                    &lt;input type='button' value='Save Meeeee'
                    onclick='document.forms["myForm"].myAction.value="save";
                    document.forms["myForm"].submit();' /&gt;
                    &lt;input type='button' value='Delete Meeeee'
                    onclick='document.forms["myForm"].myAction.value="delete";
                    document.forms["myForm"].submit();' /&gt;
                </source>
                <p>
                    ... the java part ...
                </p>
                <source>
                    class MyAction extends ActionForm implements Serializable
                    {

                    public ActionForward execute (ActionMapping map,
                    ActionForm form,
                    HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse) {

                    String myAction = req.getParameter("myAction");

                    if (myAction.equals("save") {
                    // ... save action ...
                    } else if (myAction.equals("delete") {
                    // ... delete action ...
                    }
                    }
                    }
                    }
                </source>
                <p>
                    This is just one of many ways to achieve submitting a form
                    and decoding the
                    intended action. Once you get used to the framework you
                    will find other ways
                    that make more sense for your coding style and
                    requirements. Just remember
                    this example is completely non-functional without
                    JavaScript.
                </p>

                    Here is a link
                    which utilizes the LookupDispatch action to submit forms
                    with multiple actions
                    without javascript:

                <p>
                    The framework is mainly a server-side technology.
                    We bundled in some JSP tags to expose the framework
                    components to your
                    presentation page, but past that, the usual development
                    process applies.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Interactive pages require the use of JavaScript.
                    (That's why it was invented.)
                    If you want things popping up or doing this when they
                    click that,
                    you are outside the scope of the framework and back into the web
                    development mainstream.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You use JavaScript with the framework the same way you use with
                    any presentation
                    page.
                    Since JavaScript is a client-side technology, you can use
                    simple relative
                    references to your scripts.
                    If you need to fire a JavaScript from a HTML control, the
                    Struts HTML tags
                    have properties for the JavaScript events.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A very good JavaScript resource is Matt Kruse's site at
                    <a href="http://www.mattkruse.com/javascript/">
                        http://www.mattkruse.com/javascript/</a>

            <a name="reset"/>
            <subsection
                    name="Do I need to implement reset and set all my form properties to their initial values?">
                <p>
                    No.
                    You need to set checkbox properties to false if the
                    ActionForm is being retained in session scope.
                    This is because an unchecked box does not submit an
                    attribute.
                    Only checked boxes submit attributes.
                    If the form is in session scope, and the checkbox was
                    checked, there is no way to turn it back off without the
                    reset method.
                    Resetting the properties for other controls, or for a
                    request scope form, is pointless.
                    If the form is in request scope, everything already just
                    started at the initial value.

                    name="Can't I just create some of my JavaBeans in the JSP using a scriptlet?">
                <p>
                    The framework is designed to encourage a
                    <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-12-1999/jw-12-ssj-jspmvc.html">
                        Model 2/MVC architecture</a>
                    . But there is nothing that prevents you from using Model
                    1
                    techniques in your JavaServer Pages, so the answer to the
                    question is "Yes, you can".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though, using Model 1 techniques in a framework application
                    does go against the grain.
                    The approach recommended by most developers is to
                    create and populate whatever
                    objects the view may need in the Action, and then forward
                    these through the request.
                    Some objects may also be created and stored in the session
                    or context,
                    depending on how they are used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Likewise, there is nothing to prevent you from using
                    scriptlets along with JSP tags in your pages. Though, 
                    many developers report
                    writing very complex
                    scriplet-free applications and recommend the JSP tag
                    approach to others.
                </p>

            <subsection
                    name="Why does the &lt;html:link> tag URL-encode javascript and mailto links?">
                <p>
                    The &lt;html:link> tag is not intended for use with
                    client-side references like those used to launch
                    Javascripts or email clients.
                    The purpose of link tag is to interject the context (or
                    module) path into the URI so that your server-side links
                    are not dependent on your context (or module) name.
                    It also encodes the link, as needed, to maintain the
                    client's session on the server.
                    Neither feature applies to client-side links, so there is
                    no reason to use the &lt;html:link> tag.
                    Simply markup the client-side links using the standard
                    <a/>
                    tag.

                <p>
                    Attribute minimization (that is, specifying an attribute
                    with no value) is
                    a place where HTML violates standard XML syntax rules.
                    This matters a lot
                    for people writing to browsers that support XHTML, where
                    doing so makes
                    the page invalid.It's much better for Struts to use the
                    expanded syntax,
                    which works the same on existing browsers interpreting
                    HTML, and newer
                    browsers that expect XHTML-compliant syntax. Struts is
                    following the
                    behavior recommended by the
                    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#h-4.5">
                        XHTML specification</a>

                <p>
                    <em>The Struts tags seem to provide only the most
                        rudimentary functionality.
                        Why is there not better support for date formatting
                        and advanced string handling?</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Three reasons:
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, work started on the JSTL and we didn't want to
                    duplicate the effort.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second, work started on Java Server Faces, and we didn't
                    want to duplicate that effort either.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Third, in a Model 2 application, most of the formatting
                    can be handled in the ActionForms (or in the business
                    tier),
                    so all the tag has to do is spit out a string.
                    This leads to better reuse since the same "how to format"
                    code does not need to be repeated in every instance.
                    You can "say it once" in a JavaBean and be done with it.

                    For more flexible placement of error messages,

                <p>
                    Since the Struts tags are open source, you can extend them
                    to provide whatever additional formatting you may need.
                    If you are interested in a pre-written taglib that offers
