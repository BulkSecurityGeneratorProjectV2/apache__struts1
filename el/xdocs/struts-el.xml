            <subsection name="Preface">

                <p>
                    The
                    <strong>Struts-EL</strong>
                    tag library is a contributed library in
                    the Struts distribution.
                    It represents an integration of the Struts tag library
                    with the JavaServer
                    Pages Standard Tag Library, or at least the "expression
                    evaluation"
                    engine that is used by the JSTL.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The base Struts Taglib contains tags which rely on the
                    evaluation
                    of "rtexprvalue"s (runtime scriptlet expressions) to
                    evaluate dynamic
                    attribute values. For instance, to print a message from a
                    properties
                    file based on a resource key, you would use the
                    <code>bean:write</code>
                    tag, perhaps like this:
                </p>
                <source>
                    <![CDATA[<bean:message key='<%= stringvar %>'/>]]>
                </source>

                <p>
                    This assumes that
                    <code>stringvar</code>
                    exists as a JSP scripting
                    variable. If you're using the
                    <strong>Struts-EL</strong>
                    library, the
                    reference looks very similar, but slightly different, like
                    this:
                </p>
                <source>
                    <![CDATA[<bean-el:message key="${stringvar}"/>]]>
                </source>

                <p>
                    If you want to know how to properly use the
                    <strong>Struts-EL</strong>
                    tag library, there are two important things you need to
                    know:
                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li>
                        The Struts Taglib
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The JavaServer Pages Standard tag library
                    </li>

                </ul>


                <p>
                    Once you understand how to use these two, consider the
                    Struts Taglib
                    attribute values being evaluated the same way the JSTL tag
                    attribute
                    values are.
                    Past that, there is very little else you need to know to
                    effectively use
                    the
                    <strong>Struts-EL</strong>
                    tag library.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although the
                    <strong>Struts-EL</strong>
                    tag library is a direct "port"
                    of the tags from the Struts Taglib, not all of the tags in
                    the
                    Struts Taglib were implemented in the
                    <strong>Struts-EL</strong>
                    tag library.
                    This was the case if it was clear that the functionality
                    of a particular
                    Struts tag could be entirely fulfilled by a tag in the
                    JSTL.
                    It is assumed that developers will want to use the
                    <strong>Struts-EL</strong>
                    tag library along with the JSTL, so it is
                    reasonable to assume that they will use tags from the JSTL
                    if they
                    fill their needs.
                </p>

            <subsection name="Introduction">

                <p>
                    This subproject is an extension of Struts Taglib. Each JSP
                    custom tag
                    in this library is a subclass of an associated tag in
                    Struts Taglib.
                    One difference is that this tag library does not use
                    "rtexprvalues", it uses
                    the expression evaluation engine in the Jakarta Taglibs
                    implementation of the
                    JSP Standard Tag Library (version 1.0) to evaluate
                    attribute values.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition, some of the Struts tags were not ported to
                    this library, as it was
                    determined that their functionality was entirely supplied
                    by the JSTL. These
                    particular Struts tags, and the reason for their
                    non-porting will be described
                    in the documentation for this library.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In order to fully understand the correct utilization of
                    this library, you must
                    understand the use and operation of Struts Taglib, and the
                    use and
                    operation of the JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library
                    (hereafter called the
                    "JSTL"), along with the expression language (sometimes
                    called the "EL") used
                    for evaluating attribute values.
                </p>

            <subsection name="Tag Mapping">

                <p>
                    In implementing the Struts-EL library, every Struts tag
                    that provides a feature
                    that is not covered by the JSTL (1.0) library is mapped
                    into the Struts-EL
                    library. This section reviews which Struts tags are NOT
                    implemented in the
                    Struts-EL library, and which JSTL tags provide that
                    feature.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Many of the non-porting decisions were based on the fact
                    that the JSTL
                    expression language itself provides the same
                    functionality. In those cases, in
                    addition to a possible JSTL tag name, the symbol "EL" will
                    be listed.

                    (Note that the "iterate" tag was originally ported, even
                    with the presence of
                    the "c:forEach" tag, as the "indexed tag" functionality
                    was not supported when
                    using "c:forEach" instead of "logic:iterate". This has
                    since been rectified,
                    such that the "indexed tag" functionality checks for being
                    contained in a
                    "c:forEach" tag, in addition to the "logic:iterate" tag.
                    However, the ported
                    "iterate" tag has not been removed from Struts-EL, for
                    backward compatibility.)

                    The "logic:match" and "logic:notMatch" tags have an
                    additional attribute named
                    "expr", which can take any value, and will be used as the

                <p>
                    The Struts-EL tag library requires the use of Struts
                    Taglib, and the
                    Java Server Pages Standard Tag Library. It is not
                    necessary for JSP pages
                    using the Struts-EL tag library to also use the Struts
                    tags or the JSTL tags,
                    but the Struts and JSTL tag libraries need to be part of
                    the application
                    utilizing the Struts-EL tag library.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is because the Struts-EL tag classes are all
                    subclasses of Struts tag
                    classes, and their implementation uses classes provided by
                    the JSTL.
