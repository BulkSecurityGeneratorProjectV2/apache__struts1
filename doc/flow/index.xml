    <section name="Struts Flow" href="overview">
      <p>
Struts Flow is a port of <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org">Cocoon's</a> <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/userdocs/flow/index.html">Control Flow</a> to <a href="http://struts.apache.org">Struts</a> to allow
complex workflow, like multi-form wizards, to be easily implemented using continuations-capable
JavaScript.  It provides the ability to describe the order of Web pages that have to be sent to the client, at any given point in time in an application.  
Struts Flow uses a low-impact integration method that allows an existing Struts application to use Struts Flow along side traditional Struts 
components like Actions and ActionForms.

        </p>
        <p>
        Since continuations are best implemented in Javascript, Struts Flow also focuses on making Javascript
        easier to use and better integrated into the Java environment borrowing several ideas from <a 
        href="http://groovy.codehaus.org">Groovy</a>.  First, information in Collections classes
        can be accessed using Javascript array (<code>foo[1]</code>) and object (<code>foo["bar"]</code>) notations.
        Also, Struts Flow uses <a href="http://www.json.org">JSON</a> to allow client-side Javascript running
        in a browser to call server-side Javascript flow functions.  Finally, core Java API classes like <code>java.io.File</code> have additonal methods and properties
        added to them.  For example, to process each line of a text file, you can use the following closure:
        </p>
<pre>
  file = new java.io.File("foo.txt");
  file.eachLine(
    function(line) {
      print(line);
    }
  );
</pre>
        <p>
        While the initial target of the extracted Control Flow is Struts, the Flow code and Javascript extensions
        are reusable from other 
        non-Struts environments.  This means Control Flow could be used to drive non-Struts JSP applications, portlets, or even complex web services.
