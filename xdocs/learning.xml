<section name="Learning About Struts Action Framework">

    <p>
        The <strong>official documentation</strong> for the framework is
        provided online and may be built locally from the source code
        distribution.
        To build the documentation, change to the subproject's
        folder and run
    </p>

    <p>
        $ maven site
    </p>

    <p>
        Our documentation includes a <a href="userGuide/index.html">User Guide</a>,
	<a href="./faqs/index.html">FAQs, and Howto Guides</a>, 
	along with this top-level introduction.

 <subsection name="Documentation Versions">
    <p>
        You are invited to preview the documentation online,
        and then install the documentation bundle locally for closer study.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>NOTE:</strong>
        If you are previewing the documentation on the website,
        most of the links in this section will refer to the
        <strong>Nightly Build</strong>.
        When learning about the framework,
        <strong>be sure to refer to the documentation for the version
        you are actually using</strong>.

 <subsection name="User Guide">

    <p>
        Our concise <a href="userGuide/index.html"><strong>
        User Guide</strong></a>
        introduces the Model-View-Controller architecture,
        and how it relates to the major components of the framework.
        If you want to find out "How it works", this is the place to start.
        Along with an architectural overview,
        the User Guide also includes detailed installation instructions
        and release notes for each version of the framework.
    </p>
</subsection>

 <a name="FAQS"/>
 <subsection name="FAQS and HOWTOs">

    <p>
        Our <strong>FAQs</strong> and <strong>HOWTOs</strong> are designed to fill in
        any gaps left by the Javadocs or User Guide.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Our <a href="faqs/kickstart.html">Kickstart FAQ</a>
            answers the most common non-technical questions
            people first ask about the framework.
        </li>
        <li>
            Our <a href="faqs/newbie.html">Newbie FAQ</a>
            answers the most common technical questions asked developers using 
            the framework for the first-time.
           
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The <strong>HOWTO Guides</strong> are designed to help you get started
        with some of the optional extensions and components available
        for the framework.
        These include topics like using the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol
        and how to unit test your applications.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you have any comments on the pages you see here,
        they can be posted to the Wiki by following the link
        on the bottom of any page.
    </p>

    <p>
        Of course,
        the only true documentation is the code itself.
        If you have any questions about how the framework actually works,
        do not hesitate to <em>use the source</em>.
        For the complete, buildable source code,
        see the "src" folder in your <strong>source distribution</strong>.

 <a name="Javadocs"/>
 <subsection name="Javadocs">
    <p>
        For more detail about a specific class or package,
        our <a href="apidocs/index.html"><strong>
        Javadocs</strong></a> are <strong>surprisingly comprehensive and
        carefully maintained</strong>.
        It is <em>strongly</em> recommended that you refer to the
        <a href="apidocs/index.html">Javadocs</a> for each class
        as you begin to use it.
        This will help ensure that important features and options are not
        overlooked.
        <em>What you don't know, can't help you.</em>

<a name="Examples"/>
<subsection name="Struts Action Framework by Example">
    <p>
        To help you see how it all fits together, several example applications
        are available that demonstrate using the framework with other
        Apache Struts subprojects.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Blank - A simple template for starting new applications.
        </li>
         <li>
            Cookbook - See various techniques in action and view the source code in place. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Examples - Various demonstration applications combined as separate
            modules:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Exercise - A set of test pages that also demonstrate
                    use of the custom tags.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Upload - Demonstrates using the file upload facilities.
                    (Based on Commons Upload.)

                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://opensource2.atlassian.com/confluence/oss/display/STRUTS/MailReader">
            MailReader</a> - The original Struts example
            application. <em>Try me first!</em>
        </li>
   </ul>

    <p>
        These applications are available for
        <a href="http://struts.apache.org/acquiring.html">download</a> from
        the Struts Applications subproject, in both source and binary form.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are also many third-party example applications available
        for study, including these three:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="http://raibledesigns.com/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=AppFuse">
             AppFuse</a> - Demonstrates using XDoclet with Struts Classic,
            along with different security packages and Hibernate for
            database persistence.
        </li>

<subsection name="Learning More About Struts Action Framework">
    <p>
        The Struts <a href="http://struts.apache.org/mail.html">Mailing Lists</a>
        are a treasure trove of useful, interactive information.
        The user list tends to carry a high volume,
        so always check the published documentation and one of the
        <a href="http://struts.apache.org/mail.html#Archives">
        <strong>MAILING LIST ARCHIVES</strong></a> before
        <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">posting a
        new question</a>.
        Like as not, it's already been asked and answered.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you really can't find the answer to your question in the
        <a href="#faqs">FAQs</a> or one of the
        <a href="http://struts.apache.org/mail.html#Archives">
        list archives</a>, you can post your query to the Struts User list --
        <strong>BUT YOU MUST SUBSCRIBE TO THE
        <a href="mailto:user-subscribe@struts.apache.org">USER LIST</a>
        OR THE <a href="mailto:user-digest-subscribe@struts.apache.org">
        USER LIST DIGEST</a> BEFORE POSTING</strong>. </p>

    <p>
        The Apache Struts <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/struts"><strong>
        Wiki</strong></a> is a relatively new addition to our
        documentation team.
        Any Struts user (that means you!) is invited to post new material to
        the Wiki.
        However, the Wiki is not the place to ask incidental questions.
        <strong>All support questions should be directed to the
        <a href="http://struts.apache.org/mail.html">Struts User list</a> or
        other support forum</strong>.

<subsection name="Struts Community Resources">
    <p>
        Apache Struts has attracted a large and robust community of developers,
        which have created a vast number of Struts related resources.

       <p>
       The Apache Software Foundation does not provide printed manuals,
       but several third-party books about Apache Struts are available.
