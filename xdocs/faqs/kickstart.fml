        <faq id="why">
            <question>Why do we need Struts Action Framework?"</question>
            <answer>
                <p>Java technologies give developers a serious boost when
                    creating and maintaining applications to meet the demands
                    of today's public Web sites and enterprise intranets.
                    Struts Action Framework combines standard Java
                    technologies into a unified framework. The end result is a
                    cooperative, synergistic framework, suitable for
                    development teams, independent developers, and everyone in
                    between.

        <faq id="how">
            <question>How does Struts Action Framework work?</question>
            <answer>
                <p>Java Servlets are designed to handle requests made by Web
                    browsers. Server pages are designed to create dynamic Web
                    pages that can turn billboard sites into live
                    applications. Struts Action Framework uses a special
                    Servlet as a switchboard to route requests from Web
                    browsers to the appropriate server page. This makes Web
                    applications much easier to design, create, and
                    maintain.</p>

        <faq id="compat">
            <question>Is Struts Action Framework compatible with other Java
                technologies?</question>
            <answer>
                <p>Yes. Struts is committed to supporting industry standards.
                    Struts acts as an integrator of Java technologies so that
                    they can be used in the &quot;real world&quot;.</p>

        <faq id="who">
            <question>Who wrote Struts Action Framework"</question>
            <answer>
                <p>There are several
                    <a href="../volunteers.html">active committers</a>
                    to the Apache Struts project, working cooperatively from
                    around the globe. Dozens of individual developers and
                    committers contributed to the Struts 1.x codebase. All
                    interested developers and wordsmiths are invited to
                    <a href="http://struts.apache.org/helping.html#contribute">
                        contribute to the project</a>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>The initial Struts codebase (Struts 0.5) was created by
                    Craig R. McClanahan in May 2000 and donated to The Apache
                    Software Foundation in May 2000. Craig was the primary
                    developer of both Struts 1.x and
                    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/index.html">
                        Tomcat 4</a>
                    . Tomcat 4 was the basis for the official reference
                    implementation for a servlet 2.3 and JSP 1.2 container.
                </p>
                <p>After serving as the co-lead of the JSR 127 specification
                    (JavaServerFaces), Craig created another rendition of Struts
                    based on JavaServerFaces, called Shale. Both Struts Action
                    Framework and Struts Shale are first-class citizens of the
                    Apache Struts project.</p>

        <faq id="install">
            <question>How do I install Struts Action Framework?</question>
            <answer>
                <p>To develop applications with Struts, you can usually just
                    add the Struts JAR file
                    to your Java development environment. You can then start
                    using the Struts classes as
                    part of your own application. A blank Struts application
                    (in the
                    <code>webapps</code>
                    directory, open
                    <code>struts-blank.war</code>
                    )
                    is provided, which you can just copy to get a quick-start
                    on your own brainchild.
                </p>
                <p>Aside from the Struts Action Framework jar, the blank
                    application includes the other Struts Action Framework
                    Library JARs and dependencies.
                    All dependencies are compatible with the Apache License.
                </p>
                <p>Since the full source code for Struts is available, we also
                    provide
                    <a href="../userGuide/installation.html">complete
                        instructions</a>
                    for compiling your own Struts JAR from scratch. (This is
                    actually easier than it looks!)
                </p>
                <p>Your Struts application can usually be deployed using a
                    standard WAR file. In most
                    cases, you simply deposit the WAR file on your application
                    server, and it is installed
                    automatically. If not, step-by-step installation

                        various servlet
                        containers</a>

        <faq id="jar">
            <question>When do I need &quot;struts-action.jar&quot; on my
                classpath?</question>
            <answer>
                <p>When you are compiling an application that uses the Struts
                    classes, you must have the &quot;struts-action.jar&quot;
                    on the classpath your
                    <strong>compiler</strong>
                    sees -- it does not
                    <em>have</em>
                    to be on your CLASSPATH environment variable.
                </p>
                <p>Why is that an important distinction? Because if you are
                    using a servlet container on your development machine to
                    test your application, the &quot;struts-action.jar&quot;
                    <strong>must not</strong>
                    be on your CLASSPATH environment variable when running the
                    container. (This is because each Web application must also
                    have their own copy of the Struts classes, and the
                    container will become confused if it is on the environment
                    path as well.)
                </p>
                <p>There are several general approaches to this issue:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Use ANT</strong>
                        for building your projects -- it can easily assemble
                        classpaths for the compiler. (This is how Struts
                        itself is built, along with Tomcat and most other
                        Java-based projects).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Use an IDE</strong>
                        where you can configure the "class path" used for
                        compilation independent of the CLASSPATH environment
                        variable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Use a shell script</strong>
                        that temporarily adds struts-action.jar to the
                        classpath just for compilation, for example
                        <br/>
                        <em>javac -classpath
                            /path/to/struts-action.jar:$CLASSPATH $@</em>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </answer>
        </faq>

        <faq id="tests">
            <question>Does Struts Action Framework include its own unit
                tests?</question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Struts Action Framework currently has two testing
                    environments, to reflect the fact that
                    some things can be tested statically, and some really need
                    to be done in
                    the environment of a running servlet container.</p>
                <p>
                    For static unit tests, we use the
                    <a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit framework</a>
                    .
                    The sources for these tests are in the "src/test"
                    hierarchy in the source repository, and are executed via
                    the "test.junit"
                    target in the top-level build.xml file. Such tests are
                    focused on the
                    low-level functionality of individual methods, are
                    particularly
                    suitable for the static methods in the
                    org.apache.struts.util utility
                    classes. In the test hierarchy, there are also some "mock
                    object" classes
                    (in the org.apache.struts.mock package) so that you can
                    package up things
                    that look like servlet API and Struts API objects to pass
                    in as arguments
                    to such tests.

                        Struts TestCase</a>
                    which provides a useful harness for Action classes that
                    can be used with JUnit or
