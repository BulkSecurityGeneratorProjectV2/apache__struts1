    <section name="Struts and JavaServer Faces Integration Library">
    <a name="welcome"/>

      <p>The "Struts-Faces" package contains an add-on library that supports the use of
  JavaServer Faces (JSF) user interface technology in a Struts based web
  application, in place of the Struts custom tag libraries.</p>
  
  <p>The Struts-Faces Integration Library should work with any implementation
  of JavaServer Faces, version 1.0 or later.  It has primarily been tested
  against version 1.1 of the JavaServer Faces reference implementation,
  available at:
