    <section name="Struts and JavaServer Faces Integration Library">
    <a name="welcome"/>

      <p>The "Struts-Faces" package contains an add-on library that supports the use of
  JavaServer Faces (JSF) user interface technology in a Struts based web
  application, in place of the Struts custom tag libraries.  As a proof of
  concept, it also includes the canonical "struts-example" example
  web application, converted to use JSF tags, as well as tags from the
  JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL), version 1.0 or later.  It also includes
  a very basic Tiles based application, modified in a similar manner.</p>
  
  <p>The Struts-Faces Integration Library should work with any implementation
  of JavaServer Faces, version 1.0 or later.  It has primarily been tested
  against version 1.1 of the JavaServer Faces reference implementation,
